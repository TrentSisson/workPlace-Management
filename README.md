# Getting Started with WorkPlace Management

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm install multiselect-react-dropdown`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Once previous steps are ccompleted`

a new window will appear in the browser with the Workplace Managent application open,
once there you will be directed to a login page. If you do not have an account there is a new user register link that the user can click and it will take the user to the register page to create an account.

Once the user has either logged in or registered the user will be redirected to the task list page. Once the user is there the user can use the NAV bar located at the top of the apllication to nivaigate around.
